# ColtJS Boilerplate

The ColtJS Boilerplate is a simple template designed to allow for quick deployment of all the 
components neccesary to begin working with the [ColtJS Framework](http://www.coltjs.com).

It includes the Colt source file both uncompressed and minimized, [RequireJS](http://www.requirejs.com), 
and a `main.js` file with a default `helloworld` module and template in place as well as a sample utility.

The boilerplate also contains basic styling through `css/screen.css` as well as the 
[FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/) Icon Font set.

Since the idea is that this can be used as the base structure for an application or site, the code 
and any assets are released as-is without warranty and under no license except those in place for 
the Colt Framework and any other third-party assets. The boilerplate is completely free to use 
without restriction.
