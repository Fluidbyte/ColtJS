<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>ColtJS is a simple framework allowing for easy deployment of JavaScript Applications using Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD). It's only dependency is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.requirejs.org">RequireJS</a>. The central concept behind behind 
    Colt is simplicity. The framework is built to be lightweight, flexible, and highly efficient.</p>
    
<p>There are plenty Swiss-Army-Knife frameworks out there, Colt aims to give a solid, reliable foundation with a minimal footprint and set of tools which are truly needed. It is easily expandable with <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Fluidbyte/ColtJS/tree/master/utils">utils</a> that 
    plug into the system and are only called when and if they are needed.
</p>

<p>The current version supports all modern browsers (including IE8 and above) but can easily be adapted to work with older browsers if needed.</p>

<hr><h3>Get Hands-On</h3>

<p>If you're like most dev's hands-on is the best way to get up-to-speed. I highly suggest <a href="https://github.com/Fluidbyte/ColtJS/tree/master/demo">downloading or digging through the demo</a>. It's a very simple 
    implementation which can easily be adapted as a starting point for a project and outlines the core functionality and usage of the ColtJS framework.

<h3>The Boilerplate</h3>
<p><strong>There is also a <a href="https://github.com/Fluidbyte/ColtJS/tree/boilerplate" target="_blank">Codiad Boilerplate</a> which allows for quick startup on new apps and is a great way 
    to get up and running quickly.</strong>
</p>
